# Student - I am looking for a service where I can log in with my current student information in order to purhcase items from Jays Nest and either pick up my order in a special location inside of Jays, or have the order delivered to another point on campus. With this I would like to have the option to pay with Jay Bucks or input my credit card information. It would also be great if there was an order status feature with the program.

# Worker - I want a simple application/website that allows me to keep track of what order needs to go with what robot and when.
